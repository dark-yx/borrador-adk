# Agent Development Kit Hackathon with Google Cloud

### Build multi-agent AI systems with Agent Development Kit and Google Cloud


###### Who can participate

* Above legal age of majority in country of residence  

Welcome to the Agent Development Kit Hackathon with Google Cloud. Everyone's talking about AI agents, but the real magic happens when they collaborate to tackle complex tasks \- think complex processes, data analysis, content creation, and customer support. In this hackathon, you'll build autonomous multi-agent AI systems using Google Cloud and the open source Agent Development Kit (ADK). 

This is your chance to dive deep into cutting-edge AI, showcase your skills, and contribute to the future of agent development.

### Requirements

##### What to Build

Your project must be built using Agent Development Kit and you must focus on the design and orchestration of interactions between multiple agents using ADK (Python or Java version). Build your solutions within one of the following categories:

* Automation of Complex Processes: Design multi-agent workflows to automate complex, multi-step business processes, software development lifecycle, or manage intricate tasks.  
* Data Analysis and Insights: Create multi-agent systems that autonomously analyze data from various sources, derive meaningful insights using tools like BigQuery, and collaboratively present findings.  
* Customer Service and Engagement: Develop intelligent virtual assistants or support agents built with ADK as multi-agent systems to handle complex customer inquiries, provide personalized support, and proactively engage with customers.  
* Content Creation and Generation: Build multi-agent systems that can autonomously generate different forms of content, such as marketing materials, reports, or code, by orchestrating agents with specialized content generation capabilities.

Your project must be built using Agent Development Kit and you must focus on the design and orchestration of interactions between multiple agents using ADK. While ADK is foundational, you are allowed and encouraged to enhance your solutions by integrating with other relevant technologies and frameworks within the Google Cloud ecosystem.

The project must be capable of being successfully installed and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Submission meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably addresses a Challenge and reasonably applies the requirements.

Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two by the Judges based on the following weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges. Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 per criteria and those criteria scores will be averaged per Submission.

* Technical Implementation (50%): How well is the solution technically executed? Is the code clean, efficient, and well-documented? How effectively does the project utilize the core concepts of Agent Development Kit? Did the project showcase the use of multiple AI agents working together to achieve tasks?  
* Innovation and Creativity (30%): How novel and original is the idea? Does it address a significant problem or create a unique solution?  
* Demo and Documentation (20%): Is the problem clearly defined, and is the solution effectively presented through a demo and documentation? Have they explained how they used Agent Development Kit and relevant tools? Have they included an architectural diagram?

Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 (Stage Two Score), with the highest possible Stage Two Score being 5\.

Stage Three: The Submissions that pass Stage One and Two will be evaluated based the following:

Bonus Developer Contributions: Did they provide complete and relevant optional Developer Contributions? See Optional Developer Contributions in Section 6.B.

If the Submission includes complete and requested optional Developer Contributions (a), a maximum of 0.4 points will be added to the Stage Two Score. If the Submission includes complete and requested optional Developer Contributions (b), a maximum of 0.4 will be added to the Stage Two Score. If the Submission includes complete and requested optional Developer Contributions (c), a maximum 0.2 will be added to the Stage Two Score. Each Submission will receive Final score from 1 to 6, with the highest possible Final score being 6\.

The highest-scoring Submission for each region will be selected as the potential winner(s), The highest-scoring Submission for each region (North America, Latin America, Europe-Middle East-Africa, Asia Pacific) will be selected as the potential winner(s), and the highest-scoring Submission across all regions will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner.

On or about July 9, 2025, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified by email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.  Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.

“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator.

A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a region, no prize will be awarded. Determinations of judges are final and binding.
